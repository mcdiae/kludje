KÎ»udJe
======

KludJe is a Java API that aims to exploit features introduced in Java 8 to reduce verbosity and enhance expressiveness.

Use it to:

 - Implement less verbose equals, hashCode, and toString in your classes
 - Avoid try/catch blocks in lambdas/method references with a generalized exception throwing/catching mechanism
   - Add this capability for any functional interface using the Kludje annotation processor
 - Avoid nested null checks in getter chains with a one-line call
